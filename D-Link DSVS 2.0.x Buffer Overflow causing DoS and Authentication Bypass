Description: DSVS 2.0 Desktop Application requires a password to log in and log out. A buffer overflow attack in the ‘CloudId’ parameter can cause the attacker to terminate the application without the need for a password. This will get stored as a device, so whenever the application is opened it’ll crash automatically.
